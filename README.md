## Using this starter...

1. Run `npm outdated` and update any outdated dependencies. This starter has very little that could break by doing this, so go for it.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `vite` to start the development server

## Workflow

- `ESLint` and `Prettier` preconfigured
- `normalize.css` for setting up a nice baseline to work from.
- `stylelint` with the `order` plugin, using SMACSS rules for setting the correct order

## Git Styleguide

A quick summary of the `type`s are here for reference:

> - **feat**: A new feature

> - **refactor**: Refactoring production code
